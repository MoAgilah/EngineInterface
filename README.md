# EngineInterface

> A lightweight, reusable C++ interface layer for game/visual apps that lets you plug in different graphics/audio/input backends (e.g., SFML, SDL, etc.) without changing game code.

---

## Why?

Decouple your game/application logic from any specific multimedia library. Write to a stable set of C++ interfaces once; swap the backend later (PC â†’ mobile, SFML â†’ SDL/Vulkan, mock â†’ headless tests) with minimal churn.

## Features (current & planned)

- ðŸ§© **Pure virtual interfaces** for windowing, rendering, input, timing, and resources  
- ðŸ”Œ **Backend-agnostic**: implement once per backend (e.g., SFML)  
- ðŸ§ª **Testability**: provide mock implementations for unit tests  
- ðŸ§° **Gradual adoption**: start with one backend, keep the same game code  
- ðŸ“¦ **Simple integration**: add as a Git submodule and include the headers  

> A reference backend using **SFML** lives in a separate repo: _SFMLEngine_.
